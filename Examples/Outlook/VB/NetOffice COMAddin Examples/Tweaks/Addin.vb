' *    This project shows you the Tweak attribute in NetOffice.
' *    You can set the Tweak attribute to set/manipulate NetOffice options or your own options at runtime.
' *    This can be very helpful for developers, may troubleshooting or diagnostics, whatever.
' *    All Tweak settings has to be stored as string value in the current office addin registry key. For example:(HKEY_CurrentUser\Sofware\Microsoft\Office\%Application%\Addins\YourAddin)
' *    You find all possible NetOffice default tweak settings here: http://netoffice.codeplex.com/wikipage?=Tweaks"
' *    In this project you learn how you get control about tweaks and implement your own tweaks in an easy way.*
